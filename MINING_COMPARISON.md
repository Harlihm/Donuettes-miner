## Economic Model Comparison

### DONUT Mining

```
Example: Pay 1 ETH
├─ 0.80 ETH (80%) → Previous King Glazer
├─ 0.05 ETH (5%)  → Frontend Provider
└─ 0.15 ETH (15%) → Treasury

Next price: 2 ETH
You earn: 4 DONUT/second while holding
When outbid: Get 1.6 ETH back (80% of 2 ETH)
Net profit: 0.6 ETH + all DONUT mined
```

### Donettes Mining

```
Example: Pay 1000 DONUT
├─ 800 DONUT (80%) → Previous Donette King
├─ 50 DONUT (5%)   → Frontend Provider
└─ 150 DONUT (15%) → Treasury

Next price: 2000 DONUT
You earn: 1 Donette/second while holding
When outbid: Get 1600 DONUT back (80% of 2000 DONUT)
Net profit: 600 DONUT + all Donettes mined
```

## Use Case & Target Audience

### DONUT Mining

- **Best for:** Whales, early adopters, high-risk high-reward players
- **Entry barrier:** Currently ~8 ETH (~$30,000+)
- **Value proposition:**
  - Mine the base layer token
  - Potential for large ETH profits
  - Higher emissions (4/sec)
- **Risk:** High capital requirement, price increases exponentially

### Donettes Mining

- **Best for:** DONUT holders, mid-tier participants, utility seekers
- **Entry barrier:** 100 DONUT (~$X depending on market)
- **Value proposition:**
  - Turn idle DONUT into more DONUT + Donettes
  - Lower entry point
  - Governance token potential
  - Creates DONUT utility
- **Risk:** Lower emissions (1/sec), dependent on DONUT value

## Profitability Analysis

### DONUT Mining (at 8 ETH entry)

```
Investment: 8 ETH
Next buyer pays: 16 ETH
You receive: 12.8 ETH (80%)
Net ETH profit: 4.8 ETH (60% return)
DONUT mined: 4 DONUT/sec × hold time

Example (30 min hold):
- DONUT earned: 7,200 DONUT
- ETH profit: 4.8 ETH
- ROI: 60% + DONUT value
```

### Donettes Mining (at 100 DONUT entry)

```
Investment: 100 DONUT
Next buyer pays: 200 DONUT
You receive: 160 DONUT (80%)
Net DONUT profit: 60 DONUT (60% return)
Donettes mined: 1 DNTE/sec × hold time

Example (30 min hold):
- Donettes earned: 1,800 DNTE
- DONUT profit: 60 DONUT
- ROI: 60% + Donettes value
```

### Mining Pool (Example: 0.1 ETH contribution)

```
Investment: 0.1 ETH
Pool mines at: 8 ETH (your share: 1.25%)
When outbid at 16 ETH:
- Pool receives: 12.8 ETH
- Your new value: 0.16 ETH (60% return)
- DONUT share: 1.25% of all mined DONUT

Benefits:
- Lower barrier
- Continuous participation
- Shared risk
- Auto-compounding
```

## Ecosystem Synergy

### The Circular Economy

```
ETH → [DONUT Miner] → DONUT
                         ↓
DONUT → [Donettes Miner] → Donettes + More DONUT
                               ↓
Donettes → Governance, Staking, Utility
```

### Strategy Combinations

**1. The Accumulator**

- Mine DONUT solo
- Use earnings to mine Donettes
- Compound both positions

**2. The Pooler**

- Pool ETH for DONUT
- Use DONUT for Donettes
- Maximize participation

**3. The Whale**

- Dominate DONUT mining
- Control Donettes supply
- Maximum governance power

**4. The Diversifier**

- Split capital 50/50
- Mine both simultaneously
- Balanced exposure
